## BlazorPersist

This sample demonstrates a method for persisting data over browser refreshes, with optional expiration.
 
Try clicking the counters and refreshing and/or closing the browser.

The click counts should persist.

The single Counter has a 1 minute cache timeout.

The double Counter has a 10 minute cache timeout.

Try adding/removing users from the list - they should persist refreshes/closes with no timeout.

Look at the local storage in Dev Tools (F12) to see the data.

None of the data stored leaves the browser - there is no server side to this app - the data is yours.
