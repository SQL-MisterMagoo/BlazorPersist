## BlazorPersist

This sample demonstrates a method for persisting data over browser refreshes, with optional expiration.
 
Try clicking the counters and refreshing and/or closing the browser.

The click counts should persist.

The single Counter has a 1 minute cache timeout.

The double Counter has a 10 minute cache timeout.

Try adding/removing users from the list - they should persist refreshes/closes with no timeout.

Try typing in the input box - it updates the label live on each keystroke and persists browser refreshes.

Look at the local storage in Dev Tools (F12) to see the data.

None of the data stored leaves the browser - there is no server side to this app - the data is yours.
